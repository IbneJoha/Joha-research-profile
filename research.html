                    <h3>One-Day Ahead Solar PV Power Generation Forecasting (Government and Company Projects)</h3>
                    <p>Advanced AI models, including deep learning architectures, have been deployed across 10 PV sites to accurately forecast solar power generation. The models use key features such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, cloud cover, snowfall, and power aggregation, among others, to analyze historical data, ensuring precise energy predictions. These models achieve an RMSE of less than 8%, demonstrating high forecasting accuracy.</p>

                    <h3>AI-Driven Real-Time Load Forecasting and Anomaly Detection in a Secure IIoT Environment</h3>
                    <p>This study presents a secure IIoT framework for real-time energy optimization, using a TCN-GRU-Attention model to predict active and reactive loads with high accuracy. An optimized Isolation Forest model detects anomalies, achieving 95% Precision, 98% Recall, 96% F1 Score, and near 100% Accuracy. The system is optimized for deployment on edge computing devices (e.g., SBC) and cloud servers. The system is secured with TLS, SSL, and encrypted credentials for reliable industrial operations.</p>

                    <h3>An Efficient AI Model for Real-time Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring within a Secure Edge Computing Environment</h3>
                    <p>The proposed ARBGTU-Net-NILM model enhances NILM by integrating Attention Residual Bi-GRU, Transformer, and U-Net architectures, enabling accurate and robust multi-appliance disaggregation in noisy, realworld conditions. It achieves a 51.27% F1-score improvement, and reduces MAE by 38.28% and SAE by 89.83% compared to the state-of-the-art. Designed for deployment on edge devices, it ensures secure operation with TLS/SSL and encrypted credentials and performs effectively on both REDD and real-time datasets.</p>
